                        Modern shoes have been a catastrophe for the human foot. Not only do they alter the shape 
                        of your foot over long periods of time,which consequently affects their strength and your
                        ability to maintain balance, but also plastic soles interfere with your foots ability to
                        be in direct contact with the vibrations of the Earth. In other words, the flow of energy
                        in your body, which naturally flows and connects with the flow of energy of the Earth,
                        is interrupted by the plastic soles used in modern shoes. While we believe that there is
                        some truth to the need to protect one's foot, we believe in a different approach. Rather
                        than protecting your foot from the elements, we instead bring the elements to your foot
                        so that you are permanently grounded and protected from the artificial post-industrial
                        elements we are frequently exposed to inside our homes and in our workplaces. Now nothing
                        will stop you from connecting with the Earth at any moment!
